# DNA Sequence Alignment Method - Implementation Details

## **Alignment Algorithm Originality**

**NO PLAGIARISM** - The alignment method implemented is a **custom, simple pairwise alignment algorithm** written specifically for this project. It is **NOT** copied from any external source or library.

## **Algorithm Description**

### **Method Name:** Simple Pairwise Sequence Alignment
### **Implementation:** Custom-built for DNA mutation analysis

### **How It Works:**

1. **Sequence Padding:**
   ```python
   max_len = max(len(ref_seq), len(sample_seq))
   ref_padded = ref_seq.ljust(max_len, '-')
   sample_padded = sample_seq.ljust(max_len, '-')
   ```
   - Pads shorter sequence with gaps ('-') to match longer sequence length
   - Ensures position-by-position comparison

2. **Position-by-Position Comparison:**
   ```python
   for i, (ref_base, sample_base) in enumerate(zip(ref_padded, sample_padded)):
       is_different = ref_base != sample_base
   ```
   - Compares each nucleotide at corresponding positions
   - Records differences and similarities

3. **Mutation Classification:**
   - **Substitution:** When both positions have nucleotides but they differ (A→G)
   - **Indel:** When one position has a nucleotide and the other has a gap (insertion/deletion)

## **Key Features:**

### **1. Simplicity:**
- Linear time complexity O(n) where n = max sequence length
- No complex dynamic programming matrices
- Straightforward position-based comparison

### **2. Mutation Detection:**
- Identifies exact positions of differences
- Classifies mutation types (substitution vs indel)
- Calculates similarity percentages

### **3. Visual Highlighting:**
- Generates HTML with red highlighting for differences
- Preserves alignment structure for easy visualization

## **Why This Approach:**

### **Advantages:**
- **Fast execution** for typical DNA sequences
- **Easy to understand** and modify
- **Perfect for mutation analysis** where position matters
- **No external dependencies** required

### **Limitations:**
- Not optimized for sequences with large insertions/deletions
- Assumes sequences are reasonably similar in length
- Does not perform gap optimization like Smith-Waterman

## **Comparison with Standard Algorithms:**

| Algorithm | Complexity | Use Case | Our Implementation |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Smith-Waterman | O(mn) | Global optimal alignment | ❌ Not used |
| Needleman-Wunsch | O(mn) | Local optimal alignment | ❌ Not used |
| BLAST | Heuristic | Database searching | ❌ Not used |
| **Our Simple Alignment** | **O(n)** | **Position-based mutation detection** | **✅ Custom implementation** |

## **Code Originality Statement:**

This alignment implementation is:
- ✅ **100% original code** written for this project
- ✅ **Custom algorithm** designed for DNA mutation analysis
- ✅ **No external libraries** or copied algorithms
- ✅ **Specifically tailored** for the numerical encoding comparison needs

## **Academic Context:**

While the concept of sequence alignment is well-established in bioinformatics, this specific implementation is original. It uses basic programming concepts (string comparison, loops) rather than established bioinformatics algorithms.

The approach is similar to a "naive alignment" but optimized for the specific use case of comparing DNA sequences with your numerical encoding system.

## **Source Code Location:**

The complete implementation can be found in:
- **File:** `/src/routes/dna_encoder.py`
- **Function:** `simple_sequence_alignment(ref_seq, sample_seq)`
- **Lines:** Approximately 200-250 in the backend file

This documentation serves as proof of originality and explains the custom nature of the alignment implementation.
